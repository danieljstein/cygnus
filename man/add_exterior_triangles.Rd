\usage{
add_exterior_triangles(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing the mesh data structures:
\itemize{
  \item{`pts`}{A V-by-M data table with columns `X` and `Y` containing the
  coordinates of cells and additional metadata.}
  \item{`tris`}{A F-by-4 data table containing the X,Y coordinates of each
   triangle's centroid in the first two columns, and area and
   largest height of each triangle in the last two columns.}
  \item{`edges`}{A E-by-14 data table with columns `from_pt`, `to_pt`, `from_tri`, `to_tri`,
  `x0_pt`, `x1_pt`, `y0_pt`, `y1_pt`, `x0_tri`, `x1_tri`, `y0_tri`, `y1_tri`,
  `length_pt`, `length_tri`. If only one triangle uses an edge, then the `from_tri`,
  `x0_tri`, and `y0_tri` fields will contain NaN values.}
  \item{`tri_to_pt`}{A F-by-V sparse matrix with value 1 at (i,j) if
  triangle i uses point j as a vertex.}
}}
}
\value{
A list containing the mesh data structures with (possibly)
  additional triangles. The `tris` table is updated to include the added
  external triangles. The `edge` table is updated so that boundary edges
  point to the newly added triangles. Also `pts` is unchanged, `tri_to_pt`
  is updated. Because new external triangles only have 2 associated points,
  `tri_to_pt` has rows that sum to either 2 or 3.
}
\description{
Edges at the boundary will only border a single triangle.
In order to deal with boundary conditions properly, this step
ensures that every edge has two associated triangles (which use
the edge) as well as two associated points (endpoints). The
triangles that are added are degenerate triangles centered at
the midpoint of each boundary edge.
