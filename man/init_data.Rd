\title{Generate mesh data structure from coordinates, for input to DMT analysis}
\usage{
init_data(X, Y, counts, meta_data = NULL, meta_vars_include = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{X, Y}{A pair of numeric vectors with the coordinates for each of V points.}

\item{counts}{A G x V gene-by-cell matrix of transcript counts.}

\item{meta_data}{A data frame with additional cell metadata to include.}

\item{meta_vars_include}{Names of columns in meta_data to include.}
}
\value{
A list containing the mesh data structures:
\itemize{
  \item{`pts`}{A V-by-M data table with columns `X` and `Y` containing the
  coordinates of cells and additional metadata.}
  \item{`tris`}{A F-by-4 data table containing the X,Y coordinates of each
   triangle's centroid in the first two columns, and area and
   largest height of each triangle in the last two columns.}
  \item{`edges`}{A E-by-14 data table with columns `from_pt`, `to_pt`, `from_tri`, `to_tri`,
  `x0_pt`, `x1_pt`, `y0_pt`, `y1_pt`, `x0_tri`, `x1_tri`, `y0_tri`, `y1_tri`,
  `length_pt`, `length_tri`. If only one triangle uses an edge, then the `from_tri`,
  `x0_tri`, and `y0_tri` fields will contain NaN values.}
  \item{`tri_to_pt`}{A F-by-V sparse matrix with value 1 at (i,j) if
  triangle i uses point j as a vertex.}
  \item{`counts`}{A G x V gene-by-cell matrix of transcript counts.}
}

Note that all indices stored in these data structures are 1-indexed.

\description{
Creates a mesh from point coordinates using Delauney triangulation.
Stores the points, triangles, and edges for the mesh, as well
as a mapping from each triangle to its associated vertices.
A gene-by-cell matrix can also be included, as well as additional
metadata for each point.
